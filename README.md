# OpenSSH Node Execution Plugins

This plugin provides a node-executor and file-copier using OpenSSH. Use this plugin if you want to access remote servers using SSH/SCP commands (as an alternative to the default SSH plugin of Rundeck, which is a Java Plugin based on JSCH library).

## Requirements
* Password Authentication and Passphrase need `sshpass` installed on the rundeck server.
* For passing passphrase ``sshpass`` version 1.0.6+ is needed


## Dry run mode

You can configure the plugin to just print the invocation string to the console. This can be useful when defining the configuration properties.


## Plugin Configuration Properties

* Private Key or Password Authentication.
* Private Key can be used with Passphrase
* Both password and private key are taken from the key storage.
* It accepts custom SSH settings 
* Attributes can be defined at Project or Node level (eg: ssh-authentication, ssh-password-storage-path, ssh-options, ssh-key-storage-path)
* Dry run? If set true, just print the command invocation that would be used but do not execute the command. This is useful to preview.

## Configuration

The plugin can be configured as a default node executor and file copier for a Project. Use the Simple Configuration tab to see the configuration properties. 

Also, you can define the configuration at Node Level, setting the node-executor and file-copier attributes.

```
<node name="RemoteNode" 
       description="Remote SSH Node" 
       tags="vagrant" 
       hostname="192.168.0.1" 
       osArch="Linux" 
       osFamily="x86_64" 
       osName="Linux" 
       osVersion="10.12.6" 
       username="vagrant" 
       node-executor="ssh-exec" 
       file-copier="ssh-copier" 
       ssh-authentication="password"  
       ssh-password-storage-path ="keys/node/user.password" 
       ssh-options="-o ConnectTimeout=5000"/>
```
